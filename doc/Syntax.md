# Goals

- Simple to embed in other applications
- Dynamic typing
- Small feature set but powerful

## Built-in types

- `Null`: represents the absence of a value
- `Bool`: `true` or `false`
- `Int`: 64-bit signed integer
- `Float`: double-precision floating point number
- `Str`: array of bytes, not actual characters
- `List`: ordered sequence of values, it can be heterogenous
- `Map`: hash map with key-value pairs
- `Func`: closure

Immutability is linked to "instances" rather than types (i.e. objects can be
frozen).
